Welcome to the 'WSGI Guide'
===========================

The 'WSGI Guide' is intended to be a brain dump of accumulated knowledge
and wisdom relating to the WSGI specification, its implementation and
usage. The guide will be an evolving document, with new information added
over time. Empty sections indicate topics which there is an intention to
cover at some point.

The material presented here is in no way definitive and often not backed up
by any sort of practical experience in having to deal with the described
problems. You should always consider any advice in relation to your own
situation, performing your own testing and research to validate whether it
makes any sense at all.

Major sections of this guide are as follows:
