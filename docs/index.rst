Welcome to the 'WSGI Guide'
===========================

The 'WSGI Guide' is intended to be a brain dump of accumulated knowledge
collected around the WSGI specification, its implementation and usage.

The guide is a work in progress and is expected that it will take quite a
while to complete. Empty sections indicate topics which there is an
intention to cover.
